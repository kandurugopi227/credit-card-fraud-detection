# credit-card-fraud-detection
A machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Python and Scikit-learn. This repository covers the full pipelineâ€”from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and handling class imbalance (SMOTE/ADASYN) to training models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Key focus areas include optimizing precision-recall metrics to reduce false positives and deploying scalable solutions (e.g., Flask API). The project emphasizes real-world applicability, with detailed notebooks on feature engineering, model evaluation (ROC-AUC, F1-score), and benchmarking against anomaly detection methods (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders). Ideal for learning fraud detection techniques or integrating into financial systems.
